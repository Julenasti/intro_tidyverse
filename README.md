# intro_tidyverse-dplyr
In this repository you will find some of the basic concepts to understand the core tidyverse collection of R packages (https://www.tidyverse.org/) focusing mainly on dplyr but with some touches on all the core packages. For this, you will find a couple of examples. One based on the cars dataset and the other relating annual mean temperature and CO2 emissions data from Alcal√° de Henares (Madrid).
